Hello, and welcome! I'm so glad you're here.

## About Me :
- These days, I go by "Mad", which is pronounced like the 'mod' in "modulo", and is _not_ an indication that I'm angry :-)
- This is the first project I've completed during my Software Engineering course at Thinkful, and is my first extended practice with JavaScript.
- I am a recent college graduate from Texas State University, where I studied the Spanish Langauge & Computer Science. (odd combo, I know) 
- Even though my academic background is mainly in C++, I'm having a ton of fun learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! 

## About the "Local Library Project" Assignment : 
This repo contains the solution(s) I've written for the Local Library Project assignment. The following links reference the source code for each corresponding page that is described in the project's instruction file, also linked below. 
- the [Accounts](https://github.com/mad-godinez/local_library_project/blob/main/public/src/accounts.js) page
- the [Books](https://github.com/mad-godinez/local_library_project/blob/main/public/src/books.js) page
- the [Home](https://github.com/mad-godinez/local_library_project/blob/main/public/src/home.js) page
- the [list](https://github.com/mad-godinez/local_library_project/blob/main/docs/function-instructions.md#function-instructions) of this project's required features, instructions, and expected output.

This project's main objective was to utilize JavaScript's native array methods, but there was also an emphasis on accessing & modifying object properties. 
#### * Important Note: 
   I was responsible for writing my solutions **solely** to the above documents. The rest of the documents in the repository were given to me as a package for data handling/ testing purposes and are therefore not my intellectual property.
